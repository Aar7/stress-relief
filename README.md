## Project Description and Functionality

This project was completed in 4 days using the following technologies:

- HTML for markup
- CSS + BEM model for styles
- JavaScript for enhanced functionality
- `localStorage` API

Libraries used via `npm`:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) for bundling and live dev server
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for cross-browser compatability
- [postcss](https://postcss.org/) autoprefixer
- ...and a few other useful tidbits :)

Three ideas were incorporated into this project. The Gamified Relaxation Challenge allows users to complete tasks for points and badges so long as there is data for that user. Streaks are kept and challenges are randomly generated from a pre-defined list!

The Bedtime Routine Planner helps users wind down after a long day. They can set a routine that's remembered and reminders for the night, after which they can log their sleep quality!

Finally, if you find your thoughts are racing endlessly, relax in the cosy corner where you can listen to relaxing sounds to soothe you.
